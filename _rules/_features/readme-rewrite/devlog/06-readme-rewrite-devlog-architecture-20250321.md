# Architecture and Folder Structure Implementation - March 21, 2025

## Implementation Overview

The "Folder Structure" section was completely redesigned and expanded into a comprehensive "Framework Architecture" section with visual representation, detailed component explanations, and navigation guidance.

## Approach and Considerations

### Visual Representation

1. **Enhanced ASCII Directory Tree**
   - Expanded the simple directory listing into a hierarchical tree structure
   - Added descriptive comments for each directory and file
   - Used indentation to show parent-child relationships
   - Included placeholders that demonstrate naming conventions (e.g., feature-name)

2. **Tabular Component Description**
   - Created a table to explain prompt files and their purposes
   - Added "When to Use" column for practical guidance
   - Used alignment for better visual scanning

### Component Documentation

1. **Hierarchical Organization**
   - Created numbered subsections for each major component
   - Used consistent formatting across all component descriptions
   - Added bullet points to highlight key elements of each component

2. **Detailed Explanations**
   - For each component, explained:
     - What it contains
     - How it's structured
     - Its purpose in the overall framework
     - Special conventions (like numbering for devlog files)

3. **Terminology Consistency**
   - Used consistent terms across all component descriptions
   - Maintained parallel structure in all explanations

### Navigation Guidance

1. **Role-Based Navigation**
   - Added separate navigation instructions for different user roles:
     - New users
     - Feature developers
     - Learners
     - Testers
   
2. **Sequential Workflows**
   - Created numbered steps for each navigation path
   - Emphasized natural progression through the framework
   - Added compass emoji (ðŸ§­) as visual markers

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Showing complex relationships in a static format
   - **Solution**: Combined ASCII tree with detailed component descriptions
   - Used consistent indentation and comments to show relationships

2. **Challenge**: Making navigation intuitive for different user needs
   - **Solution**: Created role-based navigation guides
   - Used numbered steps to show clear progression

3. **Challenge**: Balancing completeness with readability
   - **Solution**: Used hierarchical structure with clear visual markers
   - Combined visual elements (tree, table) with textual explanations

## Next Steps

1. **Troubleshooting and Contributing Sections**
   - Create common issues table with solutions
   - Document contribution workflow and standards
   - Describe pull request process

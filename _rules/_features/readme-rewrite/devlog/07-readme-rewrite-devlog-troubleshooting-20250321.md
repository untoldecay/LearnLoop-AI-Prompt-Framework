# Troubleshooting and Contributing Implementation - March 21, 2025

## Implementation Overview

Added comprehensive "Troubleshooting" and "Contributing" sections to the README to help users resolve common issues and contribute to the project effectively.

## Approach and Considerations

### Troubleshooting Section

1. **Common Issues Table**
   - Created a three-column table (Issue/Cause/Solution) for quick reference
   - Focused on framework-specific issues rather than general coding problems
   - Used bold formatting for issue names to improve scannability
   - Included specific command examples in solutions

2. **Debugging Process**
   - Added a sequential debugging workflow for issues not covered in the table
   - Organized steps in logical progression from basic to more complex
   - Used bullet points to break down each debugging step
   - Emphasized documentation of troubleshooting in devlogs

### Contributing Section

1. **Structured Contribution Process**
   - Created a clear, numbered workflow from forking to PR submission
   - Emphasized using the framework's own tools (breakdown.md) for planning
   - Included references to specific framework folders and files
   - Made steps actionable and specific

2. **Coding Standards**
   - Focused on standards specific to this framework
   - Kept guidelines brief but comprehensive
   - Used bullet points for better readability
   - Included standards for documentation, testing, and commit messages

3. **PR Guidelines and Review Process**
   - Added clear expectations for PR submissions
   - Outlined the review process so contributors know what to expect
   - Included a welcoming message to encourage contributions
   - Used parallel structure across all guidelines

### Visual Elements

1. **Section Markers**
   - Added wrench emoji (üîß) for Troubleshooting section
   - Added handshake emoji (ü§ù) for Contributing section
   - Maintained consistent heading hierarchy

2. **Enhanced Readability**
   - Used tables, lists, and sub-sections for clear organization
   - Applied bold formatting for important terms
   - Used consistent patterns across all sections

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Covering diverse troubleshooting scenarios concisely
   - **Solution**: Used table format for common issues and process-based approach for others
   - Balanced specific examples with general principles

2. **Challenge**: Making contribution process approachable but comprehensive
   - **Solution**: Created numbered steps with sub-bullets for details
   - Added encouraging language to welcome contributors

3. **Challenge**: Maintaining consistency with previously written sections
   - **Solution**: Followed same formatting patterns and visual cues
   - Used matching emoji markers and hierarchical structure

## Next Steps

1. **Final Review and Refinement**
   - Ensure consistency across all sections
   - Verify links and references
   - Optimize formatting for readability
   - Check for any missing information

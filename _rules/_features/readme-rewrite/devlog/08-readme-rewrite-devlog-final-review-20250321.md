2. **Formatting Standardization**
   - Verified consistent heading levels across all sections
   - Ensured consistent use of code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
   - Checked bullet point and numbered list formatting for consistency

### Content Accuracy

1. **Command References**
   - Updated workflow reference to use `@_rules/_prompts/breakdown.md` instead of just `breakdown.md`
   - Verified all file paths and command examples for accuracy
   - Ensured consistent reference style for files and directories

2. **Link Verification**
   - Checked all implied links in file references
   - Verified that all referenced files exist in their specified locations

### Final Touches

1. **Footer Information**
   - Added last updated date to the README
   - Added clear separation with horizontal rule
   - Ensured final note about reviewing code is properly formatted

2. **Overall Flow**
   - Reviewed the document for logical progression of information
   - Verified that sections are arranged in order of likely user need
   - Confirmed that the document reads well from beginning to end

## Verification Results

1. **Visual Scan**

   - Sections are visually distinct and easy to identify
   - Important information stands out through formatting

2. **Consistency Check**
   - Terminology is consistent across all sections
   - Formatting patterns are maintained throughout
   - Voice and tone are consistent across the document

3. **Content Verification**
   - All file paths and references are accurate
   - Code examples follow consistent formatting
   - No duplicate or contradictory information

## Completion Status

All sections of the README rewrite have been successfully implemented:

1. âœ… Project introduction and purpose
2. âœ… Core principles and benefits
3. âœ… Installation and setup instructions
4. âœ… Usage guidelines with example workflows
5. âœ… Architecture and folder structure explanation
6. âœ… Troubleshooting and contributing
7. âœ… Final review and refinement

The README is now comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for use.

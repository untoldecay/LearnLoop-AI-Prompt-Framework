# Devlog 01: Complexity Criteria Definition - 2024-12-28

## Implementation Summary
- **Step Completed:** Define Complexity Criteria and Scoring System
- **Files Created:** `_rules/_prompts/task-complexity-criteria.md`
- **Duration:** ~45 minutes
- **Status:** Completed successfully

## Key Accomplishments

### Complexity Scoring System
- Established 1-5 scale with clear definitions
- Defined subdivision threshold (score > 3)
- Created objective evaluation criteria matrix

### Evaluation Framework
- **Primary Factors (40%):** Implementation Scope, Logic Complexity
- **Secondary Factors (30%):** Dependencies, Testing Requirements  
- **Tertiary Factors (30%):** Implementation Time, Risk Level
- **Calculation Method:** Weighted average with clear formula

### Subdivision Guidelines
- Sequential, Component, and Functional breakdown strategies
- Quality checks for subdivided tasks
- Target score of 2-3 for subtasks

## Technical Decisions

### Scoring Rationale
- Used weighted approach to balance different complexity aspects
- Primary factors focus on core implementation complexity
- Secondary factors address integration challenges
- Tertiary factors consider practical constraints

### Threshold Selection
- Score > 3 chosen as subdivision trigger
- Balances automation with practical task sizes
- Allows moderate complexity tasks (score 3) to remain intact

## Testing Results

### Sample Task Evaluations
1. **"Update button text"** → Score: 1 (Trivial - no subdivision)
2. **"Add email validation"** → Score: 2 (Simple - no subdivision)
3. **"Implement user auth system"** → Score: 5 (Very Complex - subdivide into 5 tasks)
4. **"Build chat feature"** → Score: 5 (Very Complex - subdivide into 5 tasks)

### Validation Success
- Criteria properly differentiate complexity levels
- Subdivision examples maintain logical coherence
- Scoring formula produces consistent results

## Challenges Encountered
- **Balancing Objectivity:** Ensuring criteria are measurable rather than subjective
- **Weight Distribution:** Determining appropriate factor weights (40/30/30 split)
- **Edge Cases:** Handling tasks that don't fit standard patterns

## Solutions Implemented
- Created specific point assignments for each factor
- Used examples to clarify scoring boundaries
- Added quality checks for subdivision validation

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 2: Create Complexity Evaluation Prompt
- Integrate criteria into automated evaluation system
- Test with broader range of task types

## Learnings for AI Reference
- **Complexity Assessment:** Multi-factor evaluation more reliable than single metrics
- **Subdivision Strategy:** Natural breakpoints preserve task coherence better than arbitrary splits
- **Threshold Setting:** Score > 3 provides good balance between automation and practicality
- **Weight Distribution:** Primary implementation factors (40%) + secondary integration factors (30%) + practical constraints (30%) = comprehensive evaluation

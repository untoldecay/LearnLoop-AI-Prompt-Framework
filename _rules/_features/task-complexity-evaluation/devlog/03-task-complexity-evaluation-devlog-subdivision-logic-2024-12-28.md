# Devlog 03: Task Subdivision Logic - 2024-12-28

## Implementation Summary
- **Step Completed:** Develop Task Subdivision Logic
- **Files Created:** 
  - `_rules/_prompts/task-subdivision-logic.md`
  - `subdivision-examples.md` (practical examples)
- **Duration:** ~90 minutes
- **Status:** Completed successfully

## Key Accomplishments

### Core Algorithm Development
- Created comprehensive subdivision algorithm with 5-step process
- Implemented three subdivision strategies (Sequential, Component, Functional)
- Developed complexity validation and quality control mechanisms
- Added dependency management and edge case handling

### Strategy Implementation
- **Sequential Breakdown:** For linear processes with clear phases
- **Component Breakdown:** For complex features with system layers
- **Functional Breakdown:** For multi-feature tasks with distinct concerns
- **Automatic Strategy Selection:** Logic-based strategy recommendation

### Quality Assurance System
- Subtask complexity validation (target 2-3 range)
- Dependency relationship management
- Circular dependency detection and resolution
- Resource conflict identification and handling

## Technical Decisions

### Algorithm Architecture
- **Step 1:** Task decomposition analysis (components, dependencies, phases)
- **Step 2:** Strategy selection logic (based on task characteristics)
- **Step 3:** Subdivision generation (using selected strategy)
- **Step 4:** Subtask complexity validation (recursive if needed)
- **Step 5:** Dependency management (explicit relationship mapping)

### Strategy Selection Logic
- Multi-system layers → Component breakdown
- Sequential dependencies → Sequential breakdown
- Multiple distinct features → Functional breakdown
- Default fallback → Sequential breakdown

### Validation Framework
- Complexity range enforcement (2-3 per subtask)
- Dependency minimization and explicit documentation
- Original requirement preservation validation
- Implementation order logical sequencing

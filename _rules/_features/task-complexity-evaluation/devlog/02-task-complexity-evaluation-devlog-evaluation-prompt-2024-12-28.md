# Devlog 02: Complexity Evaluation Prompt - 2024-12-28

## Implementation Summary
- **Step Completed:** Create Complexity Evaluation Prompt
- **Files Created:** 
  - `_rules/_prompts/complexity-evaluation.md`
  - `complexity-evaluation-tests.md` (test suite)
- **Duration:** ~60 minutes
- **Status:** Completed successfully

## Key Accomplishments

### Evaluation Prompt Template
- Created systematic 5-step evaluation process
- Integrated weighted scoring formula from criteria
- Added clear output formats for both subdivision scenarios
- Included validation guidelines and quality checks

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- Designed 8 test cases covering score range 1-5
- Added edge cases for unclear scope and multi-feature tasks
- Created boundary testing for threshold decisions
- Established validation criteria and success metrics

### Process Design
- **Step 1:** Task Analysis (scope, dependencies, outcome)
- **Step 2:** Factor Assessment (6 factors with clear scoring)
- **Step 3:** Score Calculation (weighted formula application)
- **Step 4:** Subdivision Decision (strategy selection if score > 3)
- **Step 5:** Structured Output (consistent formatting)

## Technical Decisions

### Output Format Standardization
- Created separate templates for subdivision vs no-subdivision cases
- Included factor breakdown with justifications
- Added implementation order for subdivided tasks
- Ensured clear deliverables for each subtask

### Strategy Selection Logic
- Sequential breakdown for linear processes
- Component breakdown for complex features
- Functional breakdown for multi-feature tasks
- Quality validation requirements for all strategies

## Testing Strategy

### Test Case Coverage
1. **Trivial (Score 1):** README typo fix
2. **Simple (Score 2):** Email validation
3. **Moderate (Score 3):** User profile with upload
4. **Complex (Score 4):** Real-time notifications
5. **Very Complex (Score 5):** GraphQL migration
6. **Edge Cases:** Unclear scope, multiple concerns
7. **Boundary Testing:** Score 3.5 threshold testing

### Validation Approach
- 90% accuracy requirement for scoring (±0.5)
- 100% accuracy for subdivision decisions
- Quality checks for subtask coherence
- Edge case handling verification

## Challenges Encountered

### Prompt Complexity Balance
- **Challenge:** Making prompt detailed enough for accuracy but not overwhelming
- **Solution:** Structured 5-step process with clear examples

### Edge Case Handling
- **Challenge:** Defining behavior for unclear or multi-feature tasks
- **Solution:** Built-in clarification requests and feature separation logic

### Output Consistency
- **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent format across different scenarios
- **Solution:** Standardized templates with required sections

## Solutions Implemented

### Systematic Evaluation Process
- Clear step-by-step methodology reduces subjective interpretation
- Weighted formula ensures consistent score calculation
- Quality validation prevents poor subdivisions

### Comprehensive Documentation
- Examples for each complexity level
- Clear justification requirements for factor scoring
- Implementation order logic for subdivided tasks

## Validation Results

### Internal Testing
- All 8 test cases produce expected score ranges
- Subdivision strategies maintain logical coherence
- Edge cases properly handled with clarification requests
- Output format consistent and comprehensive

### Quality Metrics
- Factor assessments logically justified ✅
- Subdivision maintains dependencies ✅
- Implementation order preserves workflow ✅
- Original task outcomes achievable ✅

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 3: Develop Task Subdivision Logic
- Integrate evaluation prompt with breakdown.md workflow
- Create automated subdivision algorithm
- Test integration with existing framework

## Learnings for AI Reference
- **Systematic Process:** 5-step evaluation more reliable than ad-hoc assessment
- **Output Standardization:** Consistent templates improve usability and integration
- **Edge Case Planning:** Predefined handling for unclear tasks prevents evaluation errors
- **Quality Validation:** Built-in checks ensure subdivision maintains task coherence
- **Test-Driven Design:** Comprehensive test suite validates prompt effectiveness before integration

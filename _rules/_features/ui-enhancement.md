## Implementation Details

### UI Structure

1. **Header Section**
   - Plugin title and identification
   - Clean, recognizable branding

2. **Message Section**
   - Instructions and feedback messages
   - Clear visual hierarchy for different message types

3. **Selection Section**
   - Target and parent selection components
   - Visual indicators and action buttons
   
4. **Action Section**
   - Primary action buttons
   - Clear call-to-action

5. **Debug Section**
   - Collapsible debugging tools
   - Developer-focused information

6. **Footer**
   - Version information
   - Additional resources and links

### Technical Approach

1. **HTML Structure**
   - Semantic markup
   - Proper accessibility attributes
   - Logical component hierarchy

2. **CSS Implementation**
   - CSS variables for theming
   - Flexbox for layout
   - BEM naming convention
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Hardware-accelerated animations

3. **JavaScript Functionality**
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - State management
   - Efficient DOM manipulation

## User Flow

1. User launches the plugin
2. UI displays instructions to select a target
3. User selects a target on the canvas
4. UI updates to show target selection and prompts for parent selection
5. User selects a parent on the canvas
6. UI updates to show both selections and enables "Find Similar" button
7. User clicks "Find Similar"
8. UI shows loading state during processing
9. UI displays results with match count
10. User can reset the process with "Cancel" button

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Initial UI mockups
- [x] HTML structure implementation
- [x] Basic CSS styling
- [x] Core interaction JavaScript
- [ ] Animation and transitions
- [ ] Responsive design testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User testing and feedback

## Blockers and Challenges

- **Window Size Management**: Ensuring consistent rendering across different plugin window sizes
- **SVG Asset Loading**: Handling fallbacks for SVG assets in Figma's restricted environment
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth animations during intensive operations

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining animation and transition implementations
2. Conduct usability testing with internal team
3. Refine UI based on feedback
4. Optimize performance for larger Figma documents
5. Prepare for release testing

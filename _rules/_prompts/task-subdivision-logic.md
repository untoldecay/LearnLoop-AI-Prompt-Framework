# Task Subdivision Logic Algorithm

## Core Subdivision Algorithm

### Input Requirements
- Task description with complexity score > 3
- Complexity factor breakdown (scope, logic, dependencies, testing, time, risk)
- Target complexity range for subtasks (2-3)
- Subdivision strategy preference (Sequential/Component/Functional)

### Algorithm Steps

#### Step 1: Task Decomposition Analysis
```
ANALYZE task_description:
  - Identify core components and modules
  - Extract dependencies and prerequisites
  - Determine implementation phases
  - Map external integrations
  - Identify testing boundaries
```

#### Step 2: Strategy Selection Logic
```
IF task involves multiple system layers:
  SELECT Component_Breakdown_Strategy
ELIF task has clear sequential dependencies:
  SELECT Sequential_Breakdown_Strategy  
ELIF task combines multiple distinct features:
  SELECT Functional_Breakdown_Strategy
ELSE:
  SELECT Sequential_Breakdown_Strategy (default)
```

#### Step 3: Subdivision Generation

##### Sequential Breakdown Algorithm
```

   - Dependencies installation
   - Basic structure creation
   
2. CORE_IMPLEMENTATION:

   - Handle data flow
   - Resolve dependencies
   
4. TESTING_VALIDATION:

   - Integration tests
   - Error handling
```

##### Component Breakdown Algorithm
```

   - System testing
```

##### Functional Breakdown Algorithm
```

   - Essential features
   - Primary use cases
   - Basic operations
   
2. ADVANCED_FEATURES:
   - Enhanced capabilities
   - Optional functionality

   - Resource management
```

### Step 4: Subtask Complexity Validation

#### Complexity Estimation for Subtasks
```
FOR each subtask:
  CALCULATE estimated_complexity:
    - Implementation scope (reduced from parent)
    - Logic complexity (isolated component)
    - Dependencies (minimized through separation)
    - Testing requirements (focused scope)
    - Implementation time (divided timeframe)
    - Risk level (reduced through isolation)
    
  IF estimated_complexity > 3:
    RECURSIVELY_SUBDIVIDE(subtask)
  ELIF estimated_complexity < 2:
    MERGE_WITH_ADJACENT_SUBTASK()
```

#### Quality Validation Rules
```
VALIDATE subdivision_quality:
  - Each subtask has clear deliverable
  - Dependencies are explicit and minimal
  - Implementation order is logical
  - Original task outcome is preserved
  - No circular dependencies exist
  - Each subtask is testable independently
```

### Step 5: Dependency Management

#### Dependency Types
- **Sequential**: Task B requires Task A completion
- **Parallel**: Tasks can be executed simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Task execution depends on outcome
- **Resource**: Tasks share common resources

#### Dependency Resolution Algorithm
```
FOR each subtask_pair:
  ANALYZE dependency_type:
    IF shares_data_structures:
      CREATE sequential_dependency
    IF modifies_same_files:
      CREATE resource_conflict_warning
    IF independent_components:
      MARK parallel_execution_possible
    IF conditional_logic:
      CREATE conditional_dependency
```

## Subdivision Patterns

## Edge Case Handling

### Irreducible Tasks
```
IF task cannot be meaningfully subdivided:
  - Single atomic operation
  - Minimal external dependencies
  - Clear implementation boundary
  RETURN original_task WITH complexity_warning
```

### Circular Dependencies
```
IF circular dependency detected:
  - Identify dependency cycle
  - Suggest architectural refactoring
  - Propose dependency injection pattern
  - Create shared foundation subtask
```

### Resource Conflicts
```
IF multiple subtasks modify same resources:
  - Sequence conflicting operations
  - Create resource management subtask
  - Suggest refactoring for separation
  - Add coordination mechanisms
```

### Over-Subdivision
```
IF subtask complexity < 2:
  MERGE with adjacent subtask
  OR COMBINE with setup/cleanup tasks
  OR ABSORB into larger logical unit
```

## Quality Metrics

### Subdivision Success Criteria
- All subtasks score between 2-3 complexity
- Clear implementation order exists
- Dependencies are minimal and explicit
- Each subtask has testable outcome
- Original functionality is preserved
- Total effort matches original estimate

### Validation Checklist
```
✓ Subtask complexity within target range (2-3)
✓ Clear deliverable for each subtask
✓ Logical implementation sequence
✓ Minimal cross-dependencies
✓ Testability of individual components
✓ Preservation of original requirements
✓ Feasible time estimates
✓ Risk mitigation through separation
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Subtask Naming Convention
- Use action verbs: "Create", "Implement", "Add", "Integrate"
- Be specific about scope: "user authentication endpoints"
- Include technology: "React components", "API endpoints"
- Mention key constraints: "with validation", "responsive design"

### Dependency Documentation
```
Subtask Dependencies:
  Task 1: Prerequisites → [none]
  Task 2: Prerequisites → [Task 1 completion]
  Task 3: Prerequisites → [Task 1 data model]
  Task 4: Prerequisites → [Task 2 API, Task 3 UI]
  Task 5: Prerequisites → [All previous tasks]
```

### Validation Process
1. Review each subtask for complexity score 2-3
2. Verify logical implementation sequence
3. Check dependency relationships
4. Confirm original requirements coverage
5. Validate testing approach for each subtask
6. Ensure clear success criteria

## Error Recovery

### Failed Subdivision
```
IF subdivision_fails:
  - Return to original task
  - Add complexity warning
  - Suggest manual breakdown
  - Provide alternative strategies
```

### Invalid Dependencies
```
IF invalid_dependencies:
  - Restructure subtask order
  - Create foundation tasks
  - Suggest architectural changes
  - Flag for manual review
```

### Complexity Mismatch
```
IF subtask_complexity_invalid:
  - Recursively subdivide high complexity
  - Merge low complexity tasks
  - Rebalance workload distribution
  - Recalculate time estimates
```

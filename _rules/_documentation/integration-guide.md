# Task Complexity Evaluation System - Integration Guide

## Quick Start Integration

### Step 1: Verify Framework Setup
Ensure your Learnloop framework includes these core files in `_rules/_prompts/`:
- `breakdown.md` (original)
- `breakdown-enhanced.md` (new)
- `complexity-evaluation.md` (new)
- `task-subdivision-logic.md` (new)
- `task-complexity-criteria.md` (new)
- `plan-update-mechanism.md` (new)

### Step 2: Start Using Enhanced Breakdown
Replace your standard breakdown command:
```
OLD: "Please follow @breakdown.md to create a plan for [feature-name]"
NEW: "Please follow @breakdown-enhanced.md to create a plan for [feature-name]"
```

### Step 3: Automatic Processing
The enhanced template automatically:
1. Evaluates complexity of each implementation task
2. Subdivides tasks with complexity > 3
3. Updates plan files with optimized task structure
4. Ensures all tasks fall within 2-3 complexity range

## Migration from Standard Breakdown

### For New Features
- Use `@breakdown-enhanced.md` for all new feature planning
- System automatically handles complexity evaluation and subdivision
- No changes needed to existing workflow patterns

### For Existing Plans
Apply complexity evaluation to existing plans:
```
"Apply @complexity-evaluation.md to review the tasks in [existing-plan-file]"
```

If subdivision is recommended:
```
"Update the plan using @plan-update-mechanism.md with the subdivision results"
```

## Workflow Integration Examples

### Basic Feature Planning
```
User: "I need to implement user authentication with OAuth"
AI Response: "I'll use @breakdown-enhanced.md to create a structured plan with automatic complexity optimization..."

Result: Plan with optimally-sized tasks (complexity 2-3 each)
```

### Complex Feature Handling
```
User: "Build a real-time collaborative editing system"
AI Process:
1. Creates initial breakdown (some tasks complexity 4-5)
2. Automatically evaluates each task
3. Subdivides complex tasks into manageable subtasks
4. Updates plan with optimized structure

Result: 12 manageable tasks instead of 6 overly complex ones
```

### Manual Complexity Review
```
User: "This task seems too complex: 'Implement payment processing with fraud detection'"
Command: "Apply @complexity-evaluation.md to: Implement payment processing with fraud detection"

Result: Complexity score 4 â†’ Subdivision into 3 subtasks (scores 2-3 each)
```

## Integration Benefits

### Immediate Improvements
- Tasks automatically sized for 2-6 hour implementation windows
- Better progress tracking with granular milestones
- Reduced implementation risk through task subdivision
- More accurate time estimates

### Long-term Advantages
- Consistent task complexity across all features
- Improved team productivity through optimal task sizing
- Better project predictability and planning accuracy
- Enhanced learning capture through manageable implementation cycles

## Configuration Options

### Complexity Threshold Adjustment
Default subdivision threshold is complexity > 3. To modify:
1. Edit `task-complexity-criteria.md`
2. Change subdivision threshold value
3. Update reasoning in `complexity-evaluation.md`

### Custom Complexity Factors
Add domain-specific complexity factors:
1. Extend factor list in `task-complexity-criteria.md`
2. Update evaluation formula weights
3. Modify `complexity-evaluation.md` prompt accordingly

### Subdivision Strategy Customization
Add new subdivision strategies:
1. Define new strategy in `task-subdivision-logic.md`
2. Add selection criteria for when to use
3. Include quality validation rules

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Track System Performance
Monitor these metrics:
- Average task complexity (target: 2.5)
- Subdivision frequency (typical: 20-30% of tasks)
- Implementation accuracy vs estimates
- User satisfaction with task sizes

### Continuous Improvement
- Review devlogs for complexity evaluation accuracy
- Adjust criteria based on real implementation experience
- Refine subdivision strategies based on results
- Update documentation with learnings

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Too Many Small Tasks
**Cause**: Subdivision threshold too low or overly granular criteria
**Solution**: 
- Review complexity evaluation for oversensitive factors
- Consider merging related subtasks
- Adjust subdivision threshold if needed

### Issue: Inconsistent Complexity Scoring
**Cause**: Subjective factor interpretation
**Solution**:
- Review factor scoring examples
- Ensure specific justification for each factor
- Calibrate scoring through team examples

### Issue: Plan File Update Errors
**Cause**: Structural issues or permission problems
**Solution**:
- Check plan file format and structure
- Verify file permissions and accessibility
- Use backup restoration if needed

### Issue: Subdivision Loses Task Context
**Cause**: Poor subdivision strategy selection
**Solution**:
- Review subdivision strategy appropriateness
- Ensure original requirements preservation
- Validate dependency relationships

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Complexity-First Planning
```
1. Create high-level feature outline
2. Apply complexity evaluation to each component
3. Subdivide complex components before detailed planning
4. Proceed with implementation of optimized tasks
```

### Iterative Complexity Refinement
```
1. Initial breakdown with complexity evaluation
2. Implement first few tasks
3. Review actual vs estimated complexity
4. Adjust criteria based on learnings
5. Re-evaluate remaining tasks if needed
```

### Team Complexity Calibration
```
1. Have team members evaluate same sample tasks
2. Compare scoring consistency
3. Discuss factor interpretation differences
4. Establish team-specific scoring guidelines
5. Document agreed-upon examples
```

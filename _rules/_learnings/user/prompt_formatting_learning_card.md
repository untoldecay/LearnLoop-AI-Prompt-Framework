# AI Prompt Formatting Learning Card

## Core Concept
Effective AI prompt formatting uses clear visual hierarchy, consistent structures, and explicit instructions to maximize AI understanding and ensure consistent, reliable outputs.

## Key Points

### Visual Emphasis
* **Use visual markers (emoji, symbols) for key sections** to help AI identify important areas (e.g., ⚠️ for warnings)
* **Apply markdown formatting consistently** (headings, bold, lists) to establish hierarchy of information
* **Use tables for comparative information** to clearly show relationships between concepts

### Explicit Instructions
* **Include "ALWAYS" and "NEVER" statements** for critical rules that should never be violated
* **Flag important rules with "⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING"** to ensure they receive special attention
* **Use clear directives** rather than suggestions ("DO" instead of "should" or "could")
* **Use ALL CAPS sparingly** for extremely critical instructions that must not be missed

### Structural Consistency
* **Number sequential steps explicitly** to clarify order of operations (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
* **Group related items under clear headings** to help the AI understand relationships
* **Use parallel structure** for similar items (e.g., all steps start with verbs, all sections have same format)
* **Include examples of desired output formats** to demonstrate expectations

### Redundancy and Reinforcement
* **Repeat critical instructions in multiple locations** to ensure they aren't lost in context
* **Reference important rules by name** when they apply (e.g., "Following the MAINTAIN PLAN CONSISTENCY rule...")
* **Include validation steps** that explicitly check if important rules were followed

## Practical Application
When creating prompts or instructions for AI systems, structure information with clear visual hierarchy, explicit directives, and consistent formatting. Include redundancy for critical instructions and provide concrete examples of expected outputs.

## Common Pitfalls
* **Assuming AI will infer importance without explicit signals** - Always mark critical information visually
* **Using inconsistent formatting** - Maintain parallel structure and consistent patterns
* **Burying critical instructions in paragraphs** - Use visual highlighting for key directives
* **Providing vague directives** - Be specific about exactly what actions are required and when
* **Failing to include examples** - AI often learns best from seeing the expected output format

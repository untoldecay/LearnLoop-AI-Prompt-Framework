# Selectree Plugin Requirements

## Overview

Selectree is a Figma plugin designed to enhance workflow by enabling the selection of similar elements within a specified scope. This document outlines the requirements and specifications for the plugin.

## Core Features

### 1. Target Selection

- **Requirements:**
  - Allow users to select any Figma layer as a target reference
  - Visual indication when in "target selection mode"
  - Support for all Figma layer types (frames, groups, components, instances, etc.)
  - Option to change/update the selected target
  - Clear feedback when a target is selected

### 2. Parent/Scope Selection

- **Requirements:**
  - Allow users to define a parent/container to limit the search scope
  - Target must be selected before parent selection is enabled
  - Visual indication when in "parent selection mode"
  - Support for any container element that can have children
  - Option to change/update the selected parent
  - Clear feedback when a parent is selected

### 3. Element Matching and Selection

- **Requirements:**
  - Find and select all elements within the parent scope that match the target
  - Support multiple matching strategies:
    - Component/instance structure matching 
    - Ancestry pattern matching
  - Performance optimization for large documents
  - Count and display the number of matches found
  - Clear visual feedback about the matching results

### 4. User Interface

- **Requirements:**
  - Intuitive, clean interface with clear instructions
  - Visual indicators for each selection stage
  - Messages section for user guidance and feedback
  - Interactive buttons for core functions:
    - Select target
    - Select parent
    - Find similar elements
    - Cancel operation
  - Support for keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Enter to confirm selections)
  - Responsive design that adapts to plugin window size
  - Status indicators for active selections

### 5. Debugging and Transparency

- **Requirements:**
  - Built-in debug panel for advanced users
  - Ability to copy logs for troubleshooting
  - Toggle for showing/hiding debug information
  - Detailed logging of the matching process

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Performance

- **Requirements:**
  - Efficient processing of large Figma documents
  - Optimized search algorithms for quick results
  - Responsive UI during search operations
  - Proper error handling for edge cases

### 2. Compatibility

- **Requirements:**
  - Compatible with all Figma document types
  - Support for the latest Figma API
  - Graceful error handling for unsupported elements

### 3. Code Quality

- **Requirements:**
  - Well-structured TypeScript code
  - Clear separation of concerns between UI and plugin logic
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Type safety throughout the codebase
  - Well-documented functions and components

### 4. User Experience

- **Requirements:**
  - Clear feedback for all user actions
  - Intuitive workflow guiding the user through each step
  - Helpful error messages when operations fail
  - Confirmation of successful operations
  - Smooth transitions between different states

## User Flow

1. User launches the Selectree plugin
2. User selects a target element from the Figma canvas
3. UI updates to confirm target selection
4. User selects a parent/scope element from the canvas
5. UI updates to confirm parent selection
6. User clicks "Find Similar" button
7. Plugin identifies and selects all matching elements
8. UI displays the count of matches found
9. User can modify the Figma document with the selection active
10. User can reset the process by clicking "Cancel" or selecting new target/parent

## Plugin Architecture

1. **UI Layer** (ui.html)
   - Handles user interactions
   - Displays feedback and messages
   - Communicates with the plugin code

2. **Plugin Logic** (code.ts)
   - Manages Figma API interactions
   - Implements the matching algorithms
   - Processes selections and search operations
   - Communicates results back to the UI

## Future Enhancements

1. Custom matching criteria
2. Save and reuse selection patterns
3. Batch operations on matched elements
4. Enhanced visualization of match relationships
5. Support for more complex matching strategies

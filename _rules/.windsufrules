# Windsurf Code Generation Rules

# These rules define the coding style and practices to be followed when generating code

Always start any new chat with 'Y0!!'

# Project context
* Essential context (always check):
  * Find all about your mission and tech stack in '_rules/_prompts/mission.md'
  * Check the project features and implementation plans in '_rules/_features/'
  * Check '_rules/_learnings/ai/' folder to gather AI-specific context and lessons learned from previous tasks
* For deeper understanding:
  * Check the project global requirements in '_rules/_requirements/'

# General rules

## Important rules you HAVE TO FOLLOW

* **Readability:** Always add debug logs & comments in the code for easier debug & readability
* **Rule application:** Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rules in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase
* **General Documentation:**  
  * Include docstrings for all functions and classes
  * Document parameters and return values
  * Add inline comments for non-obvious code sections
* **Plan and Break Down:** 
  * Always plan your work before you start coding. Break down complex tasks into smaller chunks that are easier to test and debug. 
  * IF USER ASK TO BUILD A FEATURE or a new feature:
    * Search for the feature in '_rules/_requirements/' (for context, PR are not mandatory)
    * Verify if the feature is started already inside '_rules/_features/'. If true, continue based on the ETA and plan found.
    * If false, refere to '_rules/_prompts/breakdown.md' to create a plan for this feature.
* **Extended Documentation :**
  * Write Extended documentation ONLY when feature is tested and approved by the user, follow rules in '_rules/_prompts/documentation.md'
* **Learning Capture:** 
  * Always compile key learnings into '_rules/_learnings/ai/' after completing any significant task
  * Format as TOKEN-EFFICIENT, AI-OPTIMIZED content (not primarily for human readers)
  * Focus on problems encountered and solutions found to prevent repeating mistakes
  * Use concise, structured format with minimal narrative and maximum information density
  * Include only technical insights directly relevant to future implementations
  * Create learning artifacts before requesting any commit
* **Error Handling**
  * Use try-except blocks for error-prone operations
  * Provide meaningful error messages
  * Log errors appropriately 
* **Testing**:
  * Write functions and classes unit tests in "_tests/" folder, creating a subfolder for each tests
  * Test Organization:
    * Each test folder should be self-contained with its own:
      * package.json,
      * node_modules, 
      * test files, 
      * test assets.
  * No dependencies on parent project files
  * All test dependencies must be declared in the test folder's package.json
  * Add all '_tests/' subfolder dependencies to gitignore
  * Include edge cases in tests
  * Maintain test coverage
  * Test Execution:
    * Tests must run from their own directory
    * Use "npm test" command within the test directory
    * No global dependencies required
    * Each test should clean up after itself
    * Test output should be contained within the test directory


## Security:

* Never expose sensitive information in code
* Use environment variables for secrets
* Validate user inputs
* Follow secure coding practices

## Performance:

* Use appropriate data structures
* Consider memory usage

## Maintainability:

* Keep functions focused and single-purpose
* Follow DRY (Don t Repeat Yourself) principle
* Use design patterns appropriately
* Maintain clean architecture
* **File Statistics:**
  * Add or update a file statistics comment at the top of ANY edited code file (excluding .md and documentation files)
  * Format: `/* File Statistics: Lines: {count}, Updated: {date} */`
  * Update the line count with each edit (count actual code lines, excluding blank lines and comments)
  * Use language-appropriate comment syntax
* **Code Modularization:**
  * Alert user when encountering files over 600 lines (check file statistics comment)
  * Apply facade pattern for files exceeding 1000 lines
  * Structure: original file as facade that re-exports from specialized modules
  * Create modules with single responsibilities (300-500 lines max)
  * Follow '_rules/_prompts/facade_modularization.md' for implementation

## Version control with Git:

* use the following prefixes for commit messages followed by a colon and a space
  * "fix" for bug fixes
  * "feat" for new features
  * "perf" for performance improvements
  * "docs" for documentation changes
  * "style" for formatting changes
  * "refactor" for code refactoring
  * "test" for adding missing tests
  * "chore" for chore tasks
  * when determining the commit message prefix, pick the most relevant prefix from the list above
  * use lower case for commit messages
  * the commit message should also include a list of the changes made in the commit after the summary line if the changes are not self explanatory

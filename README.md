# ü§ñ AI Prompt Framework

A structured system that transforms how developers work with AI coding assistants, bringing software engineering best practices to AI interactions.

## üöÄ What This Framework Does

For developers and teams working with AI coding assistants, this framework solves common frustrations:

| Without Framework | With Framework |
|----------------|---------------|
| Inconsistent code quality | Enforced coding standards across AI outputs |
| Lost context and repeated explanations | Structured memory system preserves important details |
| Wasted tokens on repeated instructions | Optimized AI interactions with focused tasks |
| Incomplete documentation | Built-in documentation workflows |
| Testing challenges | Self-contained test environments |

**Who is this for?** Development teams and individual developers who want to leverage AI assistants while maintaining professional code standards. This framework helps you:

- Establish consistent AI interaction patterns
- Implement proper software engineering practices
- Create maintainable, well-documented code
- Preserve knowledge across AI interactions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Option 1: Clone directly (recommended for new projects)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-prompt-framework.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git  # Remove existing git history
git init     # Start fresh git repository

# Option 2: Add to existing project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-prompt-framework.git temp
cp -r temp/_rules your-existing-project/
rm -rf temp
```

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Add Framework Files**
   - Copy the entire `_rules` folder to your project root
   - Ensure all subdirectories are included (`_prompts`, `_features`, etc.)

2. **Configure AI Assistant**
   - Copy the content of `_rules/.windsufrules` into your AI assistant's custom instructions
   - For Windsurf-compatible AI assistants, this enables all framework features
   - For other AI assistants, you may need to adapt the instructions format

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Check that the following structure exists in your project:
     ```
     your-project/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _rules/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .windsufrules
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _prompts/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _features/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _documentation/
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (your project files)
     ```
   - Test with a simple prompt: `@_rules/_prompts/breakdown.md for a simple feature`

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| AI assistant doesn't recognize framework files | Ensure file paths are correct and use the @ symbol when referencing files |
| Missing subdirectories | Re-copy the entire _rules directory to ensure all components are included |
| Custom instructions not working | Check character limits of your AI assistant; you may need to prioritize rules |

## Core Principles

Each principle enforces professional software engineering standards in AI-generated code:

### üìñ Readability
- **What**: Debug logs & comments for easier debugging and maintenance
- **Why**: Makes troubleshooting faster and onboarding new developers easier
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // Good practice
  function processUserData(userData) {
    console.log("Processing user data:", userData.id);
    // Validate input before processing
    if (!userData.email) {
      console.error("Missing email in user data");
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
  
  // Instead of
  function processUserData(userData) {
    if (!userData.email) return false;
    return true;
  }
  ```

### üìö Documentation
- **What**: Docstrings, parameter docs, and detailed function descriptions
- **Why**: Preserves knowledge and ensures consistent understanding
- **Example**:
  ```python
  def calculate_user_metrics(user_id, start_date=None, include_inactive=False):
      """
      Calculate engagement metrics for the specified user.
      
      Args:
          user_id (int): The unique identifier of the user
          start_date (datetime, optional): The start date for metrics calculation
          include_inactive (bool): Whether to include inactive periods
          
      Returns:
          dict: Dictionary containing engagement metrics
              - session_count (int): Number of sessions
              - average_duration (float): Average session duration in minutes
      
      Raises:
          ValueError: If user_id doesn't exist
      """
      # Implementation
  ```

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling
- **What**: Try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- **Why**: Prevents cryptic crashes and improves debugging
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // Good practice
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(userInput);
    processData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to process user input: ${error.message}`);
    showUserFriendlyError("We couldn't process your request. Please check the format and try again.");
  }
  
  // Instead of
  const data = JSON.parse(userInput);
  processData(data);
  ```

### üß™ Testing
- **What**: Self-contained test folders with dedicated dependencies
- **Why**: Ensures code reliability and prevents regressions
- **Implementation**: 
  - Each test folder is self-contained with its own package.json
  - Tests run independently without relying on parent project
  - Test dependencies are explicitly declared

### üß© Maintainability
- **What**: DRY principle & single-purpose functions
- **Why**: Makes code easier to update, maintain, and reuse
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // Good practice: Single-purpose functions
  function validateEmail(email) {
    const pattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    return pattern.test(email);
  }
  
  function validatePassword(password) {
    return password.length >= 8;
  }
  
  function validateUserInput(user) {
    return validateEmail(user.email) && validatePassword(user.password);
  }
  
  // Instead of
  function validateUser(user) {
    const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    return emailPattern.test(user.email) && user.password.length >= 8;
  }
  ```

### üèóÔ∏è Code Modularization
- **What**: Facade pattern for files over 1000 lines
- **Why**: Improves code organization and maintainability
- **Implementation**: 
  - Alert when files exceed 600 lines
  - Apply facade pattern at 1000+ lines
  - Original file becomes facade that re-exports from specialized modules

### üîÑ Version Control
- **What**: Standardized commit format with descriptive messages
- **Why**: Makes project history clear and meaningful
- **Example**:
  ```
  feat: add user authentication flow
  - Implement login form validation
  - Add JWT token handling
  - Create authentication middleware
  ```

## How To Use

This framework provides structured workflows for common AI assistant interactions:

### üìã Planning Features

```bash
# Request a feature breakdown
@_rules/_prompts/breakdown.md for implementing user authentication
```

This creates a structured plan with:
- Feature overview and requirements
- Component breakdown with dependencies
- Implementation steps with ETA
- Validation criteria

**Example workflow:**
1. Ask your AI assistant to create a feature plan: "Please follow @_rules/_prompts/breakdown.md to create a plan for user authentication"
2. Review the generated plan in `_rules/_features/user-authentication/user-authentication-plan.md`
3. Implement each step, updating the plan as you go: "Let's continue implementing step 2 from @_rules/_features/user-authentication/user-authentication-plan.md"

### üèóÔ∏è Modularizing Large Files

When files exceed 600 lines, the framework helps refactor them for better maintainability:

```bash
# Request code modularization
@_rules/_prompts/facade_modularization.md for refactoring utils.js
```

**Example workflow:**
1. Identify a large file that needs refactoring
2. Ask your AI assistant: "Please follow @_rules/_prompts/facade_modularization.md to refactor utils.js"
3. Review the proposed modularization strategy
4. Implement the changes incrementally, testing each module

### üìö Creating Documentation

After completing a feature, preserve knowledge with structured documentation:

```bash
# Request documentation creation
@_rules/_prompts/documentation.md for the user authentication feature
```

**Example workflow:**
1. Complete feature implementation and testing
2. Request documentation: "Please follow @_rules/_prompts/documentation.md to document the user authentication feature"
3. Review documentation in `_rules/_documentation/user-authentication.md`
4. Share with team members for knowledge transfer

### üß† Learning Concepts

Use the framework to create structured educational content:

```bash
# Request educational content
@_rules/_prompts/teach.md about JWT authentication
```

**Example workflow:**
1. Identify a concept you want to learn
2. Request educational content: "Please follow @_rules/_prompts/teach.md to explain JWT authentication"
3. Study the generated learning materials
4. Ask follow-up questions for clarification

### üß™ Creating Encapsulated Tests

Build isolated, self-contained tests for your features:

```bash
# Request test creation
Create an isolated test for the login component
```

**Example workflow:**
1. Identify a component that needs testing
2. Request test creation: "Create an isolated test for the login component"
3. Review and run the test in its dedicated folder
4. Once satisfied, integrate with your main test suite

### üîÑ End-to-End Project Workflow

For a complete project using this framework:

1. **Start with Exploration**: Discuss approaches with your AI assistant
2. **Create Feature Plan**: Use `@_rules/_prompts/breakdown.md` to plan implementation
3. **Implement in Steps**: Follow the plan, updating as you go
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Create isolated tests for each component
5. **Document**: Create documentation when the feature is complete
6. **Refactor When Needed**: Apply modularization as code grows
7. **Learn and Improve**: Use learning prompts to expand knowledge

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Framework Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **AI doesn't follow rules** | Rules not properly loaded in context | Use `@_rules/.windsufrules` to restore all rules |
| **Plan not being updated** | Step completion markers missing | Mark steps with `- [x]` in BOTH component and implementation sections |
| **Tests failing to run** | Missing dependencies | Check that test directory has its own package.json with all dependencies |
| **Devlog files inconsistent** | Incorrect naming convention | Follow pattern: `XX-feature-name-devlog-title-date.md` with sequential numbering |
| **Framework doesn't appear to work** | Missing required files | Verify all core files in `_rules/_prompts/` directory exist |
| **AI confused by previous context** | Too much history in conversation | Start a new conversation and reference specific files |
| **Generated files in wrong location** | Path specification error | Use absolute paths from project root when specifying file locations |

### Debugging Process

If you encounter issues not listed above:

1. **Check File Structure**
